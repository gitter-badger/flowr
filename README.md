R pacakge to design (and deploy) complex workflows, in a effective and efficient manner on High Perfomance computing clusters.

Please visit [docs.flowr.space](http://docs.flowr.space) for more information.

Here is a shiny app, [flow_creator](https://sseth.shinyapps.io/flow_creator/) for you to start building your flow.
[`guest; guestpass`]


```
## From the official R repository (may be a few version behind)
install.packages('flowr')
## for a latest and greatest
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("sahilseth/flowr")
```

## Example:
```
library(flowr)
example(plot_flow)
```

As of now we have tested this on the following clusters:

|Platform|submission commnd|Works?|label*|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|LSF 9.1|bsub|Yes|lsf
|Torque|qsub|Yes|torque
|SGE|qsub|should work|sge
|LSF HPC 7|bsub|should work|lsf
